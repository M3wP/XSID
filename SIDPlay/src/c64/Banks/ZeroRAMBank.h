    $00/$01 unused bits emulation, as investigated by groepaz:

    - There are 2 different unused bits, 1) the output bits, 2) the input bits
    - The output bits can be (re)set when the data-direction is set to output
      for those bits and the output bits will not drop-off to 0.
    - When the data-direction for the unused bits is set to output then the
      unused input bits can be (re)set by writing to them, when set to 1 the
      drop-off timer will start which will cause the unused input bits to drop
      down to 0 in a certain amount of time.
    - When an unused input bit already had the drop-off timer running, and is
      set to 1 again, the drop-off timer will restart.
    - when a an unused bit changes from output to input, and the current output
      bit is 1, the drop-off timer will restart again
